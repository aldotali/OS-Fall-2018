Please note that Aldo and Umut were not group mates in the first project.

Partial functions from the first project were used for the second project as well.

These functions appear on the assignment handed by Aldo Tali.

They may not be exactly the same since due to the need and the requirements of this project, they were adapted for best
execution but nevertheless the overall execution and logic of functions like writeHistogramTofile or
readFileToGenerateHistogram etx is strongly based on those.

This file is given here to infer that these helpers are usable by both group members (given that it is a shared work).
