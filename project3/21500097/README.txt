Hi there,

Umut and Aldo, started implementing this project late. 

As such we have not provided for full exact functionalities but we have provided for the work that we were able to do in the given amount of time.

In part 2 of this project we were not able to mask the bits of the page addresses properly.

In part 3 we wrote a function for the heap calculation but could not test it.

All parts are given in ospartb.c.

Thank you.
